## KOTLIN QUESTIONS

### What is a data class in Kotlin?
A data class is a class designed to hold data, its primary constructor needs at least one parameter, a data class cannot be open for inheritance and automatically comes with some default functions like:
```kotlin
- copy()
- equals()
- hashCode()
- toString()
- componentN()
```
- copy() : Creates a new instance of a data class by copying an existing instance and allows modification of certain properties.
  
- equals() : Checks if two instances of a data class are equal by comparing their properties, it returns a Boolean. If two objects have the same hash code, equals() is used to verify if they are truly equal in terms of their data.
  
- hashCode() : Generates a hash code for a data class instance based on its properties. Generates an integer (hash code) that serves to identify the object in hash-based collections, like HashMap or HashSet. However, having the same hash code does not guarantee that two objects are equal, as different objects can produce the same hash code (this is called a collision).
  
- toString() : Provides a string representation of the data class, including its class name and property values.

- componentN() : The componentN functions allow you to destructure instances of data classes into their individual properties. This feature is particularly useful when you want to work with individual properties of a data class without directly accessing them by name.

```kotlin
val user = User("Alice", 30, "alice@example.com")

// Destructuring declaration
val (name, age, email) = user

println(name)  // Output: Alice
println(age)   // Output: 30
println(email) // Output: alice@example.com

```

### What is a class in Kotlin?
It is a template that defines attributes and methods, objects can be created from a class. It is used to define the structure and behavior of objects in the real world.
- It can include a primary constructor and one or more secondary constructors.
- Properties can be mutable or immutable.
- To inherit from a class, the keyword "open" is used.
- Classes are final if they are not marked with the "open" keyword.
- The base class is known as the superclass, and the derived class is known as the subclass.

### Data class vs Class
The purpose of a data class is to hold data, unlike a normal class. It must have at least one parameter, cannot be open, and has default methods that a normal class does not have. Therefore, data classes cannot be inherited.

### Which class do all Kotlin classes have in common?
They share the Any class, which acts as a superclass for all Kotlin classes. It is similar to the Object class in Java.

### Explanation of Any
The superclass of all non-null types in Kotlin, this means that any non-nullable type inherits from Any.<br>
Includes fundamental methods such as  `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

### Explanation of Any?
`Any?` can hold any type of value, including null. In Kotlin, the ? after a type indicates that the type is nullable, meaning it can represent either a value of that type or null.<br>
is used when you want to allow a variable, parameter, or return value to be any type, including `null`.

### Explanation of Nothing
In Kotlin `Nothing` is a special type that represents a value that never exists. it is used to indicate that a function or expression will never successfully complete, either because it always throws an exception or because it enters an infinite loop.

- It consistently throw an exception.
- It is specifically designed to handle fatal errors.
- It clearly signals to the compiler and other developers that a particular execution path should never continue normally.

The primary purpose of `Nothing` is to improve code clarity and safety, particularly in error handling and control flow.

```kotlin
fun throwError(message: String): Nothing {
    throw IllegalArgumentException(message)
}
```
### Explanation of Unit
In Kotlin `Unit` is a special type that represents the absence of a meaningful value. it is the equivalent of `void` in other languages like Java.<br>
When a function  doesnâ€™t explicitly return a value, its return type is inferred as `Unit`.

- Functions that perform actions but do not need to return a result should use `Unit`.
  
```kotlin
fun showMessage(message: String): Unit {
    println(message)
}
```
### Explanation of Null safety
Null safety in Kotlin was designed to prevent nullPointerExceptions. which are common sources of runtime crashes in many programming languages. Kotlin handles null safety through its type system, which distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable types.

- By default, all the types in Kotlin are non-nullable. This means that a variable of a non-nullable type cannot hold a `null` value.
```kotlin
var name: String = "John"
// name = null // This will cause a compilation error
```
- To allow a variable to hold a `null` value, you need to explicitly declare it as nullable by appending a question mark `?` to the type.
```kotlin
var name: String? = "John"
name = null // This is allowed
```
- When working with nullables types, you can use the safe call operator `?.`, if the variable is `null`, the expression returns `null` instead of throwing a `NullPointerException`.
```kotlin
val length: Int? = name?.length // if name is null, length will also be null.
```
- The Elvis operator `?:` provides a way to handle `null` values by providing a default value if the expression is `null`
```kotlin
val length: Int = name?.length ?: 0 // if name is null, length will be set to 0
```
- If you are sure that a variable is not `null`, you can use the non-null assertion operator `!!` it should be used cautiosly because if the varibable is null it will throw a  `NullPointerException`.
```kotlin
val length: Int = name!!.length //if name is null, this will throw a NullPointerException.
```
- You can use the `as?` operator for safe casting. If the cast fails, it returns `null` instead of throwing a `ClassCastException`.
```kotlin
val number: Int? = someObject as? Int
```
- You can use the `let` function with the safe call operator to execute a block of code only if the variable is not `null`.
```kotlin
name?.let {
    println("Name length: ${it.length}")
}
```
In summary null safety help us to minimize the risk of null pointer exceptions by making nullability explicit and providing safe ways to handle `null` values.
  
### Explain Inheritance
Allows creating new classes based on existing ones.
- The keyword open is used to indicate that a class can be inherited.
- Classes are final if not marked with the open keyword.
- The base class is known as the superclass, and the derived class as the subclass.
- You can alter the behavior of an inherited method using the override keyword.

In summary, inheritance allows creating class hierarchies, reusing code, extending functionalities, and achieving a more organized programming structure.

### What is polymorphism?
- The ability of objects from different classes to behave in multiple ways.
- Overriding or Overloading a method are types of polymorphism.
- We can achieve polymorphism through inheritance or interfaces.
- Polymorphism also allows treating objects from different subclasses as instances of a common superclass. For example, you can create an instance of Cat, but when used in a context where Animal is expected, it behaves like an Animal.

### What is overloading?
Method overloading refers to having methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.

### What is overriding?
Method overriding refers to providing a new implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass, giving it a new behavior in the subclass.

### What is abstraction?
It refers to modeling real-world objects by focusing on their essential aspects and relevant behaviors while hiding internal details. Examples of abstraction include classes and objects that define properties and methods.

### What is encapsulation?
It refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of a class or object, and this is achieved using access modifiers. The benefits of encapsulation are the following:<br>

- Hiding details: The internal details of a class are hidden and cannot be modified from outside the class.

- Improves security: it limits access to the member of a class and helps prevent data corruption.

- Facilitates maintenance: Internal changes can be made to the class without affecting the code that interacts with the class.

- Promotes good practices: Access is enforced through public methods.
